    "## 1.0 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The game of basketball is forever changing. Trends come and go, teams rise and fall, players' legacies are constantly being  written and re-written. \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps more than in any other sport, a single player can be the difference maker for a franchise. While teams can acquire players through a few different methods (drafts, signings, and trades), some of the most compelling stories that the NBA has to offer explore a \"Chosen One\" narrative: a young prospect turned superstar that brings the team that drafted them into championship contetion. (Ex: Magic Johson, Tim Duncan, LeBron James)\n",
    "\n",
    "For every success story, however, there are a few \"busts\" along the way. How often do we see a team place their hopes in some 19-20 year old touted as \"The Next Michael Jordan\" only for this same team to remain in the lottery for years to come? On the other end, there seem to some \"hidden gems\" taken later in the draft that come up and surprise people with their production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Human behaviour is so difficult to predict and there are limitless factors that effect player performance. Teams might not always scout correctly or coach properly, and players might not perform or develop as expected. Win Shares, VORP, and Plus/Minus are far from perfect measures of player value, and there are so many unfounded expectations and overwhelming uncertainties. Such is the nature of the NBA Draft.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this article, I aim to quantify value of different draft picks and explore how draft position might be related to player performance**. We likely will not find a terribly strong, generalizable model in our analysis, but this exploration *might* still provide insight on the nature of NBA draft picks."

    "## 2.0 Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample**: We have pulled 16 draft classes (1989 to 2005) as our sample (n = 962 players).\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin from 1989 because the modern draft format (two rounds of draft picks) was introduced in 1989, and the NBA has kept the two-round format since then. We end with 2005 because there are players drafted in 2006 and beyond that might still produce \"prime\" seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Player Value**: To measure the “value” of each draftee, I am using a statistic referenced on [BoxScoreGeeks.com][1]: Brocato Prime Wins. We are interested in a draftee’s **five** best regular seasons organized by **total Win Shares** (WS). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will refer to this measure as \"Prime Win Shares\", \"Prime Wins\", or \"Prime WS\" from this point forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Sources**: I pulled Draft Position data from [Basketball-Reference.com][2] & I pulled Regular Season data from [Kaggle.com][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Analysis**: The analysis was done using Python. Data was organized using Pandas, numerical operations were implemented using NumPy and scikit-learn, statstical tests were performed using SciPy & Statsmodels, and plots were drawn using Plotly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**:\n",
    "1. What to do with draftees that did not play in the NBA or play 5 seasons?\n",
    "    * We will include any/all the seasons we can, but seasons of absence we will fill with no production: 0 Win Shares.\n",
    "    * Likewise, \"non-players\" will be treated as though they produced 0 Win Shares over their entire career.\n",
    "    * We want to include these abscences because at the end of the day, we wish to determine the value of a draft pick. Even if the draft pick was used on a player that never played in the NBA, this should still be accounted for in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why use total Win Shares instead of time/pace adjusted measures?\n",
    "    * I decided to use total Win Shares over Win Shares per 48 Minutes (WS/48), because I wanted to value overall impact over efficiency.\n",
    "    * Players with high WS/48 might be highly efficient, but their impact is limited if they are rarely on the court.\n",
    "    * A player with relatively lower WS/48 that plays many more minutes can still provide great utility for a team/franchise.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why are we using the five best seasons?\n",
    "    * According to [The Guardian][4], The average nba career length is around 4.9 years. Five seasons of data should cover the average nba career.\n",
    "    * Using the five *best* seasons will give us an idea of the player's peak. I wish to ignore injuries and would like to mostly look at player peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confounding Effects?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Draft Position and Team Investment\n",
    "    * Differences in draft position may be coupled with different degrees of team investment.\n",
    "    * Franchises could be more inclined to build their team around a player on which they have used a higher draft pick. This would could positvely impact draftee's on court performance.\n",
    "    * By design, higher draft picks are supposed to go to worse teams. Less talented prospects might not have to play as well to be awarded with more minutes, and on average, more minutes produces more Win Shares. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Draft Position and Personal Investment\n",
    "    * Differenes in draft position come with differences in player salary.\n",
    "    * Players with more money can afford to invest in themselves to a greater degree.\n",
    "    * While teams/coaches should be investing in their own players, and the NBA pays its players very well, there is still an inherent difference in pay between different picks of the same draft class.\n",
    "    * Ex: In 1989, the first overall pick, Pervis Ellison, recieved \\\\$2.4 million from the Sacremento Kings. The first pick in the 2nd round (28th overall), Sherman Douglas, was only paid \\\\$325k. \n",

    "From a narrative perspective, an inverse logarithmic relationship between Draft Position and Prime Wins would make sense as the league tends to be somewhat \"top heavy\" between players when investigating most statistics. On [Basketball-Reference.com][2], it even states that when looking at BPM, \"there are far more below-average players than above-average players in the league at any time\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If we ignore undrafted players and assume draft pools mimic the player pool of the entire NBA, we can excpect each draft to be comprised of a few strong performers, while most of the draft is made up of less impactful players. Hence, \\***there can be a large difference between selecting 1st and selecting 5th**.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other side, the difference between **the 55th and 60th picks may be relatively small** for somewhat related reasons. Towards the end of the draft, where many prospects might appear to be future \"below average\" players, so many draftees become \"non-players\" in our dataset. Whether these picks are were caught in a contract with another league, or they just weren't impressing NBA teams, many later picks end up with 0 Prime Win Shares.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might \"dampen' the value of later draft picks and might keep the average measure of Prime Wins closer to 0 for the later draft positions.\n",
